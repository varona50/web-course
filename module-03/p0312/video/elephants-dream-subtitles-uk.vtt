00:20.083 --> 00:22.000
... голова snarlers

2
00:24.583 --> 00:27.083
Емо?

3
00:47.042 --> 00:48.542
Вам боляче?

4
00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Я не думаю, що так. Ви?

5
00:55.167 --> 00:57.042
Я Ok.

6
00:57.125 --> 01:01.167
Вставай. Емо, це не безпечно.

7
01:02.042 --> 01:03.167
Ходімо.

8
01:03.167 --> 01:05.167
Що далі?

9
01:05.208 --> 01:09.208
Ви побачите!

10
01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
(Воет вітер)

11
01:16.042 --> 01:18.083
Емо. Сюди.

12
01:34.250 --> 01:35.542
Слідуй за мною!

13
01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
(Дзижчання дроти і chattery розмов)

14
02:11.125 --> 02:12.542
Поспішайте Емо!

15
02:20.292 --> 02:22.792
(Гучні телефонні голоси)

16
02:32.000 --> 02:34.500
(phone ringing)

17
02:48.083 --> 02:50.000
You're not paying attention!

18
02:50.167 --> 02:54.125
I just want to answer the... ...phone.

19
02:55.000 --> 02:58.042
Emo, look, I mean listen.

20
02:59.167 --> 03:02.083
You have to learn to listen.

21
03:03.167 --> 03:05.042
This is not some game.

22
03:05.083 --> 03:09.417
You, i mean we, we could easily die out here.

23
03:10.042 --> 03:14.042
Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.

24
03:18.083 --> 03:20.083
Listen to your breathing.

25
03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
(Buzzing wires)

26
03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
(laughing)

27
04:13.417 --> 04:15.417
(oriental dance music)

28
04:27.042 --> 04:29.042
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

29
04:29.125 --> 04:31.000
Tired?!?

30
04:31.167 --> 04:34.583
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

31
04:35.125 --> 04:37.167
One move out of place...

32
04:37.208 --> 04:39.208
...and you're ground to a pulp.

33
04:41.000 --> 04:42.083
But isn't it -

34
04:42.083 --> 04:46.125
Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want, pulp?

35
04:47.083 --> 04:49.083
Emo, your goal in life...

36
04:50.125 --> 04:52.042
...pulp?

37
05:08.000 --> 05:10.500
(loud metal sounds)

38
05:41.208 --> 05:43.125
Emo, close your eyes.

39
05:44.208 --> 05:46.125
Why? - Now!

40
05:51.208 --> 05:52.208
Ok.

41
05:53.167 --> 05:54.792
Good.

42
05:59.125 --> 06:02.208
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

43
06:04.083 --> 06:06.000
Nothing. - Really?

44
06:06.083 --> 06:07.208
No, nothing at all.

45
06:08.000 --> 06:12.083
And at your right, what do you see at your right side, Emo?

46
06:13.208 --> 06:16.208
The same Proog, exactly the same...

47
06:17.000 --> 06:19.208
...nothing! - Great.

48
06:25.208 --> 06:27.208
(sound of camera flash)

49
06:29.792 --> 06:31.792
(engine drone)

50
06:40.167 --> 06:42.833
Listen Proog! Do you hear that! (amusement park music)

51
06:43.167 --> 06:45.000
Can we go here?

52
06:45.042 --> 06:48.000
There? It isn't safe, Emo.

53
06:49.208 --> 06:52.125
But... - Trust me, it's not.

54
06:53.083 --> 06:54.208
Maybe I could...

55
06:54.208 --> 06:56.083
No.

56
06:57.167 --> 07:00.042
NO!

57
07:00.208 --> 07:03.167
Any further questions, Emo?

58
07:04.042 --> 07:05.208
No.

59
07:09.125 --> 07:10.208
Emo?

60
07:11.208 --> 07:13.125
Emo, why...

61
07:13.125 --> 07:14.125
Emo...

62
07:14.125 --> 07:18.125
...why can't you see the beauty of this place?

63
07:18.208 --> 07:20.167
The way it works.

64
07:20.208 --> 07:24.000
How perfect it is.

65
07:24.000 --> 07:27.083
No, Proog, I don't see.

66
07:27.125 --> 07:30.083
I don't see because there's nothing there.

67
07:31.125 --> 07:35.083
And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?

68
07:35.125 --> 07:37.042
Well can you tell me that?

69
07:37.125 --> 07:39.042
Answer me!

70
07:43.042 --> 07:44.125
Proog...

71
07:45.125 --> 07:47.083
...you're a sick man!

72
07:47.083 --> 07:49.042
Stay away from me!

73
07:52.125 --> 07:55.000
No! Emo! It's a trap!

74
07:55.208 --> 07:57.042
Hah, it's a trap.

75
07:57.042 --> 08:01.167
At the left side you can see the hanging gardens of Babylon!

76
08:02.042 --> 08:04.083
How's that for a trap?

77
08:05.125 --> 08:07.042
No, Emo.

78
08:09.083 --> 08:12.208
At the right side you can see... ...well guess what...

79
08:13.000 --> 08:14.792
...the colossus of Rhodes!

80
08:15.208 --> 08:16.167
No!

81
08:16.167 --> 08:22.042
The colossus of Rhodes and it is here just for you Proog.

82
08:51.083 --> 08:53.042
It is there...

83
08:53.042 --> 08:56.167
I'm telling you, Emo...

84
08:57.083 --> 09:00.000
...it is.

85
09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
(howling wind)
